## Introduction
Text size is now huge and growing rapidly on the Internet and on all websites and social media sites. For example, Twitter, Facebook, airline sites, and reservation sites contain thousands of reviews created by users and customers from requesting services, complaints, or ratings of sites, and it is impossible for human mental capacity to process reviews even when the shortcut on the document's relevance. Therefore, there is an urgent need to use technologies or tools provided by Information Retrieval (IR) systems to accomplish this task, which is the Text Summary Tool. Current approaches operate on small, homogeneous English datasets, and do not consider multilingualism and change of opinion. In this project, we present a research plan for using Feature-Based in hotel guest reviews in US to create summaries and outline future trends in the abstract. By solving current problems, we will make it easier for site users to make more informed decisions
